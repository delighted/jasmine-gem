# Jasmine Gem 3.9 Release Notes

This release updates the jasmine-core dependency to 3.9.0. See the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/3.9.0.md)
for more information.

## Deprecation, Webpacker support, and a path forward for Rails users

The [jasmine-browser-runner](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner)
NPM package supports all of same use cases as the `jasmine` Ruby gem. It can
also handle Webpacker, which isn't supported by the gem. See the [setup instructions, including Rails-specific steps](https://jasmine.github.io/setup/browser.html).

The Jasmine Ruby gems are deprecated. There will be no further releases after
the end of the Jasmine 3.x series. We recommend that most users migrate to 
`jasmine-browser-runner`. If `jasmine-browser-runner` doesn't meet your needs, 
one of these might:

* The [jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm) npm package to run
  specs in Node.js.
* The [standalone distribution](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine#installation)
  to run specs in browsers with no additional tools.
* The [jasmine-core](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) npm package if all
  you need is the Jasmine assets. This is the direct equivalent of the
  `jasmine-core` Ruby gem.
