# Jasmine Gem 3.9.2 Release Notes

3.9.2 fixes an issue where parts of the gem description were stripped out and
not displayed on rubygems.org. It is identical to 3.9.0 except that the gem 
description mentions that it is deprecated in favor of the
`jasmine-browser-runner` NPM package. See the
[3.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-gem/blob/main/release_notes/3.9.0.md)
for more information.
